#### summary

This paper proposes a novel approach to approximate butterfly counting in bipartite graphs. This algorithm exploits the properties of the bipartite graph. This approach is highly efficient as it captures a quadratic number of butterflies with linear cost. Further, this paper sample vertices with probabilities proportional to their degrees and adjust the final output to ensure its unbiasedness. 

What's more, they generalize the above solution to approximate bi-triangle counting. They did theoretical analysis and experiments using multiple large real datasets. The results show that their methods reach high accuracy significantly faster than SOTA.

#### Advantages

1. This algorithm exploits properties of the bipartite graph.
2. This algorithm achieves a lower asymptotic time complexity compared to the SOTA.
3. This algorithm can extend to bi-triangle counting. 



#### Disadvantages

1.
